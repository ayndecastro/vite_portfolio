# React Portfolio

This is a template repository for building a portfolio website using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The template includes a client-side application built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, and a server-side application built using Node.js and Express. The client-side application is responsible for rendering the user interface, while the server-side application is responsible for serving the client-side application and handling API requests.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a fast development server with hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Yarn**: A fast, reliable, and secure dependency management tool.
- **ESLint**: A pluggable JavaScript linter that helps identify and fix problems in your code.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent coding style.

## Directory Structure

- `client`: The client-side application, built using React, Vite, and Babel.
- `server`: The server-side application, built using Node.js and Express (or any other server-side technology).

## Getting Started

1. **Create a New Project from the Template**: Go to the template repository on GitHub and click on the "Use this template" button. Then, create a new repository from the template.
2. **Rename the Project**: After creating a new repository, rename it to your project's name. Then, clone the new repository to your local machine, navigate into it, and change the name in your `package.json` files (both in the client and server directories) to your new project's name.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate into your client and server directories, and install the necessary dependencies using Yarn.
4. **Start the Application**: In your client directory, run `yarn start` to start the application in development mode. In your server directory, run `yarn start` to start the server.
5. **Build the Application**: In your client directory, run `yarn build` to build the application using Parcel, which will compile the application and copy the files to the /server/build directory.
